## Technology: ZWD-RAS

PBF's core innovation is completing BOTH the nitrogen AND carbon cycles using biological processes, enabling true zero water discharge. Standard RAS only handles partial cycles.

### ZWD vs Standard RAS

| Feature | Standard RAS | PBF ZWD-RAS |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Daily water exchange | 3-30% | <1% (evaporation only) |
| Nitrogen cycle | Partial | Complete (aerobic + anaerobic) |
| External water source needed | Yes | No, can be anywhere |
| Discharge to environment | Yes | Zero |
| Location flexibility | Limited to coast | Unlimited |

### Core IP Components
1. Biological Water Treatment (aerobic + anaerobic reactors)
2. Custom-Designed Equipment (foam fractionator, pH control, ozone sterilization)
3. Engineering Innovations (gravity-driven flow, horizontal well pumps)

## Value Proposition

### For Investors
1. Only proven commercial ZWD technology globally
2. Location flexibility - build near markets, not coasts
3. Premium species with high margins (yellowtail $18-20/kg)
4. ESG/sustainability story - zero environmental discharge
5. Simplified permitting vs coastal aquaculture

### For Markets
